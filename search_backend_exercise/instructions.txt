Imagine you've received a code review request from a junior developer on your team.  Their code (in the attached file) is intended to maintain a sorted list of items. They plan to use this code as priority queue implementation in a runtime performance-critical application.

Your task has four parts:
1. Identify any problems in their code as implemented
2. Provide suggestions about how the code could be better designed/structured given its intended application
3. Implement your suggestions from #1 and #2
4. Add following methods to your improved class:
 - Find: this method will be used to find a given node in the queue
 - Remove: this method will be used to remove a given node from the queue
 Make any reasonable assumptions necessary in choosing a method signature and design strategy when implementing these methods.

In your solution, please include written descriptions of problems/suggestions identified in parts #1 and #2, as well as separate versions of your code corresponding to parts #3 and #4.
